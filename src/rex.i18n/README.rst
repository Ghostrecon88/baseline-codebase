This is a prototype/proof-of-concept implementation of I18N features on the
RexDB platform.

Stay tuned for details.

Warnings:

* This package makes use of the prototype/experimental changes in the
  ``commonjs`` branch of ``rex.setup``.
* The JavaScript library exposed by this package makes use of a
  still-in-development third party library named Globalize_. It is not yet
  feature complete, and can't actually be properly installed by NPM yet. We
  should consider contributing to this project to help move it along.
