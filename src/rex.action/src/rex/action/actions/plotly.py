class Plotly(Action):
    """Draw plots with plotly library.

    Basic usage example::

        type: plotly
        title: Gender

        plot:
            type: bar
            name: Gender (All participant)

        query: |
            /individual^sex{sex :as x, count(^) :as y}

    This plots a barchart using data from ``query`` field.

    The ``plot`` field is a Plotly configuration for a plot (you can find docs
    about possible parameters at `,<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference>`_).

    The ``query`` field is an HTSQL query which returns data to plot. Note that
    ``x`` and ``y`` are required for ``barchar`` plot type as specified in
    plotly docs at `<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference>`_.

    More sophisticated example which renders multiple datasets at once::

          type: plotly
          title: Gender (Bar Chart, multiple traces)

          layout:
            barmode: group

          plot:
            all:
              type: bar
              name: All
            recruited:
              type: bar
              name: Recruited
            enrolled:
              type: bar
              name: Enrolled

          query: |
            {
              all := /individual^sex{sex :as x, count(^) :as y},
              recruited := /study_recruitment^individual.sex{sex :as x, count(^) :as y},
              enrolled := /study_enrollment^individual.sex{sex :as x, count(^) :as y}
            }

    Note here we defined multiple queries in ``query`` field and multiple plot
    configurations in ``plot`` fields. Each plot key must correspond to query
    key.

    Another example which renders a plot using a query which refers to a context
    variable::

          type: plotly
          title: Gender By Study Recruitment

          input:
          - study: study

          plot:
            type: pie

          query: |
            /study_recruitment?study=$study^individual.sex{sex :as label, count(^) :as value}


    Note that to refer to context variables in ``query`` we need to define
    ``input`` field with context requirements.
    """

    name = 'plotly'
    js_type = 'rex-action', 'Plotly'

    input = EntityAction.input.__clone__()

    query = Field(
        SyntaxVal(), transitionable=False,
        doc="""
        HTSQL query which produces data for plot

        There are requirements which are imposed by specified plot type in
        ``plot`` field.

        For example for ``barchart`` plot type where should be ``x`` and ``y``
        fields present in dataset. For ``pie`` - ``labels`` and ``values``.

        Consult Plotly docs at `<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference>`_ for more
        info.

        Plot configuration

        Consult Plotly docs at `<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference>`_ for more
        info.

        Note that ``data array`` attributes are specified through ``query``
        field as they need to be fetched from database with HTSQL query and not
        specified in configuration as static values.
