  REX.SETUP -- Distutils extension for the Rex platform
*********************************************************


``rex.setup`` is a Distutils extension for distributing static files
and providing additional metadata for Rex applications.  To use,
add the following lines to ``setup.py``::

    setup(
        ...
        setup_requires=['rex.setup'],
        rex_static='...',
        rex_prefix='...',
        rex_init='...',
        ...
    )

``rex_static``
    The directory containing static data and configuration to
    distribute and install with the package.
``rex_prefix``
    The default URL root under which the package is served by
    the HTTP server; when not set, ``/<package>`` is used.
``rex_init``
    The name of a Python module or a function to invoke
    when the application is initialized.  Use ``:`` to separate
    the function name from the module name.

When the package is installed, static files are copied to
``<base>/share/rex/<package>``.  Additional metadata is stored in
``*.egg-info`` in the following files:

``rex_static.txt``
    The directory where static files are stored.
``rex_prefix.txt``
    The value of ``rex_prefix`` parameter.
``rex_init.txt``
    The value of ``rex_init`` parameter.
