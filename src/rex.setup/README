  REX.SETUP -- Distutils extension for the Rex platform
*********************************************************


``rex.setup`` is a Distutils extension for distributing static files
and providing additional metadata for Rex applications.  To use,
add the following lines to ``setup.py``::

    setup(
        ...
        setup_requires=['rex.setup'],
        rex_data=[...],
        rex_prefix='...',
        rex_load='...',
        ...
    )

``rex_data``
    A list of files and directories which contain static data
    and configuration to distribute and install with the package.
``rex_prefix``
    The default URL root under which the package is served by
    the HTTP server; when not set, ``/<package>`` is used.
``rex_load``
    The name of the Python module to load when the application is
    initialized.  The module should register package-specific plugins
    and extensions.

When the package is installed, static files are copyed to
``<base>/share/rex/<package>``.  Additional metadata is stored in
``*.egg-info`` in the following files:

``rex_data.txt``
    The directory where static files are stored.
``rex_prefix.txt``
    The value of ``rex_prefix`` parameter.
``rex_load.txt``
    The value of ``rex_load`` parameter.
