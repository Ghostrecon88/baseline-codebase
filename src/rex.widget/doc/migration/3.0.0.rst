Rex Widget 3.0.0 Migration Guide
================================

Python widgets now bind to JS components differently (``js_type`` attribute).

Instead of ``js_type`` attribute being previously a string interpreted as
CommonJS module now it is changed to be a tuple of a CommonJS package name and a
symbol inside the package's entry (usually ``lib/index.js``).

For example, if previously widget was declared as::

    class MyWidget(Widget):
        js_type 'my-pkg/lib/MyWidget'

Now it shoild be changed to::

    class MyWidget(Widget):
        js_type = 'my-pkg', 'MyWidget'

and JS package's ``index.js`` should contain::

    export const MyWidget = ...
    // alternatively: export class MyWidget

Note that in case of the old ``js_type`` attribute format is being used the
application won't start and will report an error message with instructions on
how to update the ``js_type`` attribute format.
