================================

Rex Widget 2.0.0 ships with the following breaking changes:

* Rex Widget now exposes its functionality through ES2015 Modules::

    import {Button} from 'rex-widget/ui'

  instead of::

    var RexWidget = require('rex-widget')
    var Button = RexWidget.Button

  previously.

* ``<Button />`` component was re-made from scratch and feature different style
  architecture. Button variants are different components::

    <SuccessButton />

  instead of::

    <Button type="success" />

  previously.

* ``<Tabs />`` and ``<Tab />`` were reimplemented with the new API.

  Use::

    import {TabList, Tab} from 'rex-widget/ui'

  or::

    import {PillList, Pill} from 'rex-widget/ui'

  instead. Interface is similar but there were few props renamed:

  * ``active`` to ``selected``
  * ``onActive`` to ``onSelected``
  * ``buttonsPosition`` to ``position``
  * ``buttonsStyle`` is removed, use either ``<TabList />`` or ``<PillList />``
    to control tab list appearance.

* ``RexWidget.Icon`` was removed.

  Use::

    import {Icon} from 'rex-widget/ui'

  instead.

* ``RexWidget.Layout.VBox`` and ``RexWidget.Layout.HBox`` were removed and
  replaced with ``rex-widget/layout`` API::

    import {HBox, VBox} from 'rex-widget/layout'

* ``RexWidget.DataTable`` was removed, use::

    import {DataTable} from 'rex-widget/datatable'

  instead.

* Data specification API was removed and replaced with the new data API residing
  in ``rex-widget/data`` module.
