Form fields
===========

Form fields is a mechanism in Rex Widget to configure forms through YAML.
Packages like Rex Action use form fields as a part of their configuration API
(for example to configure ``make``, ``edit`` or ``view`` actions).

Usually it looks like::

  fields:
  - type: string
    value_key: first_name
  - type: string
    value_key: last_name

Common configuration parameters
-------------------------------

Some of the form field parameters are common across types. They are documented
below. For type specific parameters consult the form fiel type reference.

**type** (optional, default: ``string``)
  Type of the form field. If not provided then it defaults to ``string``.

**value_key** (required)
  Specifies a key path inside the form value which this form field should
  operate on.

**label** (optional)
  Label of the form field.

**hint** (optional)
  Hint of the form field. Provide useful information here which will help users
  to correctly enter the form value.

**required** (optional, default: ``false``)
  If the form field should be required. Form won't submit if value is not
  present in its value.

**read_only** (optional, default: ``false``)
  If the form field should render in read only mode which doesn't allow users to
  modify its value.

**hide_if** (optional)
  JavaScript expression which can reference ``$value`` (the current value of the
  field) and ``$fields`` (the value of the fieldset the field is in). If the
  expression evaluates to ``true`` then form field will be hidden and its value
  won't be present in the form value on submit.

  Example::

    - value_key: age
      type: number
    - value_key: address
      type: string
      hide_if: $fields.age < 18

  In this case the ``address`` form field will be hidden if user entered ``age``
  value which is less than ``18``.

**validate** (optional)
  HTSQL expression which is used to validate the form field value. It can
  reference ``$value`` (the value of the field) and ``$id`` (the identifier of
  the record being edited; or ``null()`` if it is not available).

  If HTSQL expression returns ``null()`` then validation succeeds; otherwise
  return a string which is treated as error message.
