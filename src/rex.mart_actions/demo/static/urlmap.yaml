        Welcome to the RexMartAction Demo System!

        This demo is a lot more useful if you have at least a handful of Marts
        created in its environment. To do so, run commands like these a few
        times::

          rex mart-create -o test -d schools
          rex mart-create -o test -d schools_with_dict

        (Assuming the user you're logging in with is ``test``)
