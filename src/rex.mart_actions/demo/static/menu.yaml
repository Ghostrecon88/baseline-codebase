            Welcome to the RexMartAction Demo System!

            This demo is a lot more useful if you have at least a handful of Marts
            created in its environment. To do so, run commands like these a few
            times::

              rex mart-create -o test -d world -d world_with_dict

            (Assuming the user you're logging in with is ``test``)
